Hey there, just wanted to let you know that not only am I not dead, I've been exploring my artistic talents...

So, I'm over my aversion to alternate accounts, and I am becoming more stable by the day.
Any interest in bringing me back on board?
I am happy to relinquish control, because honestly, I was never happier than when I was working with you guys.
I sincerely apologize for melting down when I was triggered, I have spent the past few months conditioning my mind NOT to simply react - had I just kept my mouth shut when I was besieged, D'Harhan's reputation likely would have survived.
arryqk@gmail.com for msn messenger, I've also got Instagram, SnapChat, WhatsApp, and various other apps that are geared towards monetization...
Honestly, I need to figure out how to make a couple grand month to survive on with a minimum of time invested so I can focus on our passion project. 
Thoughts?
